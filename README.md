# Thesis_Imputation_Project
This repository includes the code for the first part of my thesis project in which I analyze different imputation methods in PBMC data.

The original gene expression and surface protein counts of the 10k PBMCâ€™s Dataset from 10X Genomics can be found: https://www.10xgenomics.com/resources/datasets/10-k-pbm-cs-from-a-healthy-donor-gene-expression-and-cell-surface-protein-3-standard-3-0-0

To apply the pipeline for a analyzing gene expression results, either use the orignal counts or imputed counts, as desired.
- To use MAGIC for the imputaiton, use the pipeline as it's attached here. 
- To use DeepImpute/scGNN for the imputaiton, follow the instruction on each of their GitHub pages respectively, and upload the imputed CSV file to the pipeline.

The easily reproduce MASKING results here are links to the CSV files of the:
